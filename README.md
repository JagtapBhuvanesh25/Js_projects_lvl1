## üìÇ Repository Structure

Each folder contains an independent mini project. You can run any project independently by simply opening its respective `index.html` file in your web browser.

| Folder | Project Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Project1` | **Number Guess Game** | A fun game where users try to guess a randomly generated number with hints (higher/lower). Focuses on **conditionals and loops**. |
| `Project2` | **To-Do List** | Simple to-do app allowing users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. Demonstrates **DOM manipulation and event handling**. |
| `Project3` | **Color Flipper** | Randomly changes background colors on button clicks. Covers **arrays, event listeners, and inline styling** via JS. |
| `Project4` | **Digital Clock** | Displays real-time clock using `setInterval()` and the `Date` object. Teaches **time formatting and live updates**. |
| `Project5` | **Quiz App** | Multiple-choice quiz with scoring and feedback system. Reinforces **functions, state management, and conditional rendering**. |
| `Project6` | **Counter App** | Simple counter that increments, decrements, and resets. Highlights **event listeners and DOM updates**. |
